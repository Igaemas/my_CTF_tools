## Introduction

This Python script serves two primary purposes:

1. **Pattern Creation for Buffer Overflow Detection:**
   - Generates character patterns to facilitate easier detection of buffer overflow points during debugging.
   - The function `createPattern` creates sequences of characters for easier identification of overflow points within a debugger.

2. **Identification and Payload Generation for Buffer Overflow:**
   - When executed with the `-l` flag, the script identifies the byte position at which the buffer overflow occurs.
   - It generates a test payload to be used for testing purposes, replacing the designated register with the sequence "BBBB".

## Usage

### Pattern Creation

To create a pattern of characters:

```bash
python script.py <length_of_pattern>
```

This generates a pattern of characters with a length of 100.

### Buffer Overflow Detection and Payload Generation Example

```bash
python script.py -l <pattern>
```

This identifies the byte position at which the pattern occurs in the generated pattern list and generates a test payload to replace the overflowed register with BBBB.
